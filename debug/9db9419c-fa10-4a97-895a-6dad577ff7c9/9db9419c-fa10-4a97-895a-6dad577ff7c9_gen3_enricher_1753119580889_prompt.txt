Analyze each business idea and calculate key metrics:

Required fields in business_case object (ALL monetary values in millions USD):
- "npv_success": 5-year NPV if successful in $M (discounted at 10% annually)
- "capex_est": Initial capital required in $M (e.g., 0.075 = $75K)
- "timeline_months": Time to first revenue
- "likelihood": Success probability (0-1)
- "risk_factors": Array of key risks (technical, market, regulatory, execution)
- "yearly_cashflows": Array of 5 yearly cash flows in $M

IMPORTANT: All monetary values must be in millions. Examples:
- $50K = 0.05
- $100K = 0.1
- $1M = 1.0
- $50M = 50.0

Analysis steps:
1. Market size and growth potential
2. Revenue projections by year (in $M)
3. Cost structure and capital requirements (in $M)
4. Risk assessment across all dimensions
5. NPV calculation using 10% discount rate

  {
    "core_mechanism": "Value is created by converting underutilized land into profitable charging hubs, increasing foot traffic for gas stations, and providing essential charging infrastructure for growing electric truck fleets. Costs and risks are minimized by leveraging existing infrastructure and shared resources.",
    "description": "Create community-based charging hubs in partnership with local municipalities and existing gas stations. Utilize underused land next to gas stations to set up quick-charging stations focused on electric truck fleets. This collaboration with gas stations allows sharing utilities, security, and maintenance costs.",

  },
  {
    "core_mechanism": "The partnership leverages existing truck stops, reducing initial setup costs. Solar companies gain new markets, truck stops increase their service offerings, and fleets benefit from cheaper, green energy. Timing is ideal due to increasing sustainability incentives and electric fleet adoption.",
    "description": "Partner with solar energy companies to install solar panels at major truck stops. The generated solar energy is sold to electric truck fleets at these stops, offsetting energy costs and earning tax incentives. This reduces dependency on grid electricity and provides a sustainable charging option.",
    "idea_id": "solar_truckstop_integration_v2"
  },
  {
    "core_mechanism": "Property owners generate revenue from otherwise idle parking spaces; fleets access widespread charging infrastructure without high capital costs. The subscription model ensures predictable revenue while fleets benefit from a reliable charging network, supporting increased electric vehicle adoption.",
    "description": "Develop a subscription-based charging network tailored for electric truck fleets by forming alliances with property owners of commercial parking lots. Fleets subscribe for a monthly fee to access a network of strategically located chargers, ensuring availability and predictability.",
