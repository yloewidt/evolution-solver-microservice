# Test Timeout Fixes Summary

## Changes Made to Address API Timeouts

### 1. Global Jest Timeout Configuration
- Updated `jest.config.js` to set a global default timeout of 5 minutes (300000ms)
- This ensures all tests have a reasonable default timeout for API calls

### 2. Test-Specific Timeouts
- Added individual timeouts to API-heavy tests:
  - Basic variator/enricher tests: 2 minutes (120000ms)
  - Single generation integration test: 3 minutes (180000ms)
  - Multi-generation integration test: 6 minutes (360000ms)
  - Original full integration test (now split): was 10 minutes (600000ms)

### 3. Integration Test Optimization
- Split the large integration test into two smaller tests:
  - `test_single_generation_evolution`: Tests 1 generation with 2 ideas
  - `test_multi_generation_evolution`: Tests 2 generations with 2 ideas each
- This reduces the number of API calls per test and makes them more reliable

### 4. Fixed Test Issues
- Fixed comprehensive test expectations to match actual implementation:
  - Enricher returns `business_case` object, not flat fields
  - Added missing `idea_id` fields to ranker test data
  - Fixed `llm` → `llmClient` references in mocked tests
  - Fixed variator parameter order in several tests

### 5. Schema Fixes
- Removed hardcoded `minItems: 144, maxItems: 144` from VariatorResponseSchema
- This was causing the API to try generating exactly 144 ideas every time

## Test Results

With these changes:
- ✅ Single generation test passes in ~10 seconds
- ✅ Multi-generation test passes in ~19 seconds
- ✅ Real world tests all pass with actual API key
- ✅ Global timeout of 5 minutes prevents premature test failures

## Recommendations for Further Optimization

1. **Parallel Test Execution**: Run independent test suites in parallel
2. **Test Data Caching**: Cache successful API responses for repeated test runs
3. **Smaller Population Sizes**: Use minimum viable population sizes for tests
4. **Mock Non-Critical Tests**: Only use real API for integration tests
