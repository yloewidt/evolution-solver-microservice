# Production Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the critical production fixes implemented to address stability issues in the Evolution Solver Microservice.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Worker Failure Detection ✅
**Problem**: Workers could get stuck indefinitely without detection, causing jobs to hang forever.

**Solution**: Added timeout detection in `orchestratorService.js`:
- Monitors phase start times (variatorStartedAt, enricherStartedAt, rankerStartedAt)
- Detects timeouts after 5 minutes of inactivity
- Handles both Date objects and Firestore timestamp formats
- Automatically triggers retry via RETRY_TASK action

**Code changes**: `src/services/orchestratorService.js` lines 82-97, 111-127, 141-157, 213-224

### 2. Retry Logic for LLM Calls ✅
**Problem**: Transient failures (rate limits, timeouts) caused permanent job failures.

**Solution**: Implemented retry mechanism in `evolutionarySolver.js`:
- Added `retryLLMCall` method with exponential backoff
- Retries on status codes: 429, 500, 502, 503, 504
- Retries on connection errors: ECONNRESET, ETIMEDOUT
- Configurable via environment variables
- Does NOT retry on client errors (4xx except 429)

**Code changes**: `src/core/evolutionarySolver.js` lines 37-75, integration with variator/enricher

### 3. Atomic Operations for Race Conditions ✅
**Problem**: Concurrent phase updates could corrupt job state.

**Solution**: Implemented Firestore transactions in `resultStore.js`:
- `updatePhaseStatus` now uses atomic transactions
- Prevents duplicate phase starts
- Safely handles concurrent updates
- Added reset capability for retries

**Code changes**: `cloud/firestore/resultStore.js` lines 356-409

### 4. Graceful Degradation ✅
**Problem**: Enricher failures would fail entire jobs.

**Solution**: Added fallback behavior in `evolutionarySolver.js`:
- If enricher fails and graceful degradation enabled, uses default values
- Default business case: NPV=$5M, CAPEX=$1M, likelihood=50%
- Allows job to continue despite enrichment failures
- Configurable via EVOLUTION_GRACEFUL_DEGRADATION env var

**Code changes**: `src/core/evolutionarySolver.js` lines 447-463

## Configuration

New environment variables:
```bash
EVOLUTION_ENABLE_RETRIES=true        # Enable retry logic
EVOLUTION_MAX_RETRIES=3              # Max retry attempts
EVOLUTION_GRACEFUL_DEGRADATION=true  # Enable graceful degradation
```

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite in `test/fixes.test.js`:
- 17 test cases covering all fixes
- Tests timeout detection with various timestamp formats
- Validates retry logic with different error types
- Confirms atomic operations prevent race conditions
- Verifies graceful degradation behavior

## Deployment Notes

1. **No Breaking Changes**: All fixes are backward compatible
2. **Gradual Rollout**: Can be enabled/disabled via environment variables
3. **Monitoring**: Watch for RETRY_TASK actions in logs
4. **Performance**: Minimal overhead - only activates on failures

## Metrics to Monitor

After deployment, monitor:
- Job completion rate (should increase)
- Worker timeout occurrences (new metric)
- Retry attempt counts per phase
- Graceful degradation activations
- Average job completion time

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Run load tests to verify stability
3. Monitor for 24 hours
4. Gradual production rollout
5. Set up alerts for timeout/retry patterns

## Success Criteria

- No more stuck jobs (0 jobs hanging > 30 minutes)
- 95%+ job completion rate (up from current ~80%)
- Reduced manual intervention requirements
- Better handling of transient API failures
