2gen x 50ideas,3,hub_crop_share_v1,"OFFSPRING: A network of modular plug-and-play vertical farming racks installed in under-utilized spaces of large commercial buildings (lobbies, atriums, rooftop mechanical rooms). The operator supplies the racks, seeds and remote IoT control; the building owner supplies the space and electricity in exchange for a revenue share and ESG reporting benefits. Produce is pre-sold via micro-subscriptions to employees/tenants and via just-in-time supply contracts to the building’s cafeteria or nearby restaurants. A servicing route team harvests multiple buildings daily using e-cargo bikes. Capex is funded by a green-bond marketplace where impact-minded investors buy notes backed by the subscription cash-flows, reducing operator cash needs.","",0.00,3.00,0.00,0.35,0.336,N/A
2gen x 50ideas,3,window_algae_eco_film,"WILDCARDS: Install transparent micro-algae bioreactor films on high-rise windows, turning the façade into a protein micro-farm. The film passively circulates nutrient solution and harvests algae paste weekly via the building’s maintenance cradle. The operator sells the high-value spirulina to urban juice bars and cosmetic manufacturers while the building enjoys reduced solar heat gain (lower HVAC costs) and earns carbon-sink credits. Up-front costs are covered by an energy-service-contract (ESCO) model: savings on electricity plus a share of algae revenue repay installation over 5–7 years.","",0.00,1.50,0.00,0.25,0.240,N/A

Partner with transit authorities that want extra rental income and better air filtration: the farm’s fresh-air exchange captures tunnel dust and CO₂ while the network’s waste heat keeps the grow rooms at ideal temperatures. Prefab rack modules slide in without structural changes, and spent mushroom substrate is cycled to rooftop community gardens, closing the nutrient loop.","",0.00,0.80,0.00,0.32,0.136,N/A

Each hub marries three proven micro-technologies: (1) black-soldier-fly pods that turn the host’s food waste into protein meal and organic fertiliser, (2) vertical hydroponic racks growing salad greens for on-site retail and employee subscription boxes, and (3) slim algae panels fixed to façades that absorb building CO₂ and yield high-value spirulina powder. The operator installs and services the modular units; the host supplies space, utilities, and a guaranteed waste stream, in exchange for rent credits and ESG reporting rights.","",0.00,2.50,0.00,0.38,0.109,N/A
2gen x 50ideas,6,metro_circushiitake_hub_v2,"A plug-and-play ‘circular food pod’ that slots into unused subway mezzanines or underground parking niches. Inside, coffee-ground-fed gourmet mushrooms grow on rolling racks while overhead NFT channels raise leafy greens using the spent mushroom water. At the back end, a compact black-soldier-fly bin turns the pod’s post-harvest waste—and food scraps from station vendors—into protein meal sold to nearby pet-food makers. Riders buy fresh produce and farm-to-go snacks from an automated kiosk at platform level, and transit agencies get a revenue share plus improved air-quality metrics for ESG reports.","",0.00,1.20,0.00,0.35,0.217,N/A

Daytime, the algae panels harvest CO₂ and waste heat from HVAC exhaust; night-time, that stored heat and filtered CO₂ are piped indoors to turbo-charge shiitake and oyster production.

Servers generate steady 30-35 °C waste-heat water that is routed through insulated tanks raising tilapia. The nutrient-rich, warm effluent then feeds an attached hydroponic greenhouse growing tomatoes and herbs year-round, before returning cooled to the servers, trimming the facility’s cooling bill. Fish and produce are pre-sold via subscription to nearby restaurants under ‘hyper-local zero-emission’ branding, and the datacenter receives utility rebates for reduced grid cooling load.","",0.00,4.00,0.00,0.30,-0.097,N/A
