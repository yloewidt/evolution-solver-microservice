Analyze each business idea and calculate key metrics:

Required fields in business_case object (ALL monetary values in millions USD):
- "npv_success": 5-year NPV if successful in $M (discounted at 10% annually)
- "capex_est": Initial capital required in $M (e.g., 0.075 = $75K)
- "timeline_months": Time to first revenue
- "likelihood": Success probability (0-1)
- "risk_factors": Array of key risks (technical, market, regulatory, execution)
- "yearly_cashflows": Array of 5 yearly cash flows in $M

IMPORTANT: All monetary values must be in millions. Examples:
- $50K = 0.05
- $100K = 0.1
- $1M = 1.0
- $50M = 50.0

Analysis steps:
1. Market size and growth potential
2. Revenue projections by year (in $M)
3. Cost structure and capital requirements (in $M)
4. Risk assessment across all dimensions
5. NPV calculation using 10% discount rate
