Analyze each business idea and calculate key metrics:

Required fields in business_case object (ALL monetary values in millions USD):
- "npv_success": 5-year NPV if successful in $M (discounted at 10% annually)
- "capex_est": Initial capital required in $M (e.g., 0.075 = $75K)
- "timeline_months": Time to first revenue
- "likelihood": Success probability (0-1)
- "risk_factors": Array of key risks (technical, market, regulatory, execution)
- "yearly_cashflows": Array of 5 yearly cash flows in $M

IMPORTANT: All monetary values must be in millions. Examples:
- $50K = 0.05
- $100K = 0.1
- $1M = 1.0
- $50M = 50.0

Analysis steps:
1. Market size and growth potential
2. Revenue projections by year (in $M)
3. Cost structure and capital requirements (in $M)
4. Risk assessment across all dimensions
5. NPV calculation using 10% discount rate

  {
    "core_mechanism": "The partnership enables logistics centers to save on energy costs and allows solar companies to expand their market. The charging hubs offer subscription-based services to electric truck fleets, providing a consistent revenue stream. By leveraging existing logistics locations, capital costs are minimized.",
    "description": "Partner with solar energy companies and large logistics centers to create shared solar-powered truck charging hubs. These hubs are located at strategic points on major logistic routes and use solar panels on-site to provide energy, reducing the dependency on grid electricity.",

  },
  {
    "core_mechanism": "Value is captured through a pay-per-swap or subscription model. Battery manufacturers benefit from increased sales, while fleet operators reduce downtime for charging. The program uses existing truck stops to minimize infrastructure investment, and partnerships with leasing companies help integrate the solution into fleet operations efficiently.",
    "description": "Develop a battery exchange program by collaborating with battery manufacturers and truck leasing companies. Implement swappable battery technology to allow trucks to exchange depleted batteries for fully charged ones at designated locations.",

  },
  {
    "core_mechanism": "By using municipal land and resources, the cost of establishing charging stations is reduced. The microgrids provide reliable, low-cost power to fleets and capture value through long-term charging contracts. Local authorities benefit from reduced emissions and increased use of renewables, aligning with sustainability goals.",
    "description": "Form alliances with municipal governments and local utility providers to create microgrids specifically for electric truck charging. These microgrids use renewable energy sources and are strategically placed in urban areas with high freight traffic.",
