Analyze each business idea and calculate key metrics:

Required fields in business_case object (ALL monetary values in millions USD):
- "npv_success": 5-year NPV if successful in $M (discounted at 10% annually)
- "capex_est": Initial capital required in $M (e.g., 0.075 = $75K)
- "timeline_months": Time to first revenue
